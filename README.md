# Boolean-model-of-cell-wall-stress-signalling-in-A.-fumigatus-
Two boolean models of carbon metabolism signalling in A. fumigatus in response to cell wall (cell_wall_stress.txt) stress and osmotic stress (osmotic_stress.txt)
Both of these models are perturbed to mimic possible new drug targets: RlmA (cell_wall_stress_RlmA_perturbation) and SskB (osmotic_stress_SskB_perturbation)
